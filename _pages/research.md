Nuclear quantum effects, such as hydrogen tunneling effect, is ubiquitous in chemical and biological systems. It is challenging to describe these effects with multicomponent quantum chemistry methods, due to the importance of both static and dynamical electron-proton correlations. Here, we developed Multistate Density Functional Theory under the framework of Nuclear-Electronic Orbital method, which is proved to successfully describe hydrogen tunneling effects in a series of molecular systems. This opens the possibility of calculating the hydrogen tunneling splitting and monitoring proton wave functions, in an efficient but accurate manner.

Vibrational spectra is a powerful tool to decipher the geometrical and dynamical information of molecular systems. However, for strongly anharmonic systems like protonated water clusters, it remains a challenge for theory to identify the origin of their surprisingly red-shifted or blue-shifted OH stretch features, together with their lineshapes. We successfully resolved the above problems for vibrational spectra of difference sizes of protonated water clusters, applying vibrational self-consistent field/virtual state configuration interaction (VSCF/VCI) method. We further extended this method to the 1D/2D IR spectra calculation of strongly anharmonic aqueous proton and short strong H-bond systems (FHF<sup>+</sup>). Our results achieve excellent agreement with experiemntal measurements.

To investigate important properties of molecular systems, such as vibrational spectra and dynamical process, highly accurate potential energy surface (PES) is usually required due to its high accuracy and cheap computational cost. Thus, developing highly accurate potential energy surface for gas-phase and condensed phase systems is a hot but challenging research direction. We focused on developing different machine learning methods, including permutational invariant polynomial (PIP), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and Neural Network (NN), to tackle the PES construction problem. For large molecular systems like water and hydrated proton, we developed an universal potential energy model which can be applied for arbitrary sizes of water molecules utilizing the idea of many body expansion. This strategy has been proved to be successful for a variety of tests. Our constructed PES for water and hydrated proton can provide cheap calculation of potential energy at CCSD(T)/aVTZ level of accuracy. Such methods have also been applied to other systems including FHF<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>.
