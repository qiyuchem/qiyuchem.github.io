Nuclear quantum effects, such as hydrogen tunneling effect, is ubiquitous in chemical and biological systems. It is challenging to describe these effects with multicomponent quantum chemistry methods, due to the importance of both static and dynamical electron-proton correlations. Here, we developed Multistate Density Functional Theory under the framework of Nuclear-Electronic Orbital method, which is proved to successfully describe hydrogen tunneling effects in a series of molecular systems. This opens the possibility of calculating the hydrogen tunneling splitting and monitoring proton wave functions, in an efficient but accurate manner.
