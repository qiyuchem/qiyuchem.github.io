Nuclear quantum effects, such as hydrogen tunneling effect, is ubiquitous in chemical and biological systems. It is challenging to describe these effects with multicomponent quantum chemistry methods, due to the importance of both static and dynamical electron-proton correlations. Here, we developed Multistate Density Functional Theory under the framework of Nuclear-Electronic Orbital method, which is proved to successfully describe hydrogen tunneling effects in a series of molecular systems. This opens the possibility of calculating the hydrogen tunneling splitting and monitoring proton wave functions, in an efficient but accurate manner.

Vibrational spectra is a powerful tool to decipher the geometrical and dynamical information of molecular systems. However, for strongly anharmonic systems like protonated water clusters, it remains a challenge for theory to identify the origin of their surprisingly red-shifted or blue-shifted OH stretch features, together with their lineshapes. We successfully resolved the above problems for vibrational spectra of difference sizes of protonated water clusters, applying vibrational self-consistent field/virtual state configuration interaction (VSCF/VCI) method. We further extended this method to the 1D/2D IR spectra calculation of strongly anharmonic aqueous proton and short strong H-bond systems (FHF<sup>+</sup>). Our results achieve excellent agreement with experiemntal measurements.
